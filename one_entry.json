    "sentence": "I had the Samsung A600 for awhile which is absolute doo doo . You can read my review on it and detect my rage at the stupid thing . It finally died on me so I used this Nokia phone I bought in a garage sale for $ 1 . I wonder y she sold it so cheap ? . . . Bad : = = = > I hate the menu . It takes forever to get to what you want because you have to scroll endlessly . Usually phones have numbered categories so u can simply press the # and get where you want to go . = = = > It ' s a pain to put it on silent or vibrate . If you ' re in class and it rings , you have to turn it off immediately . There ' s no fast way to silence the damn thing . Always remember to put it on silent ! I learned that the hard way . = = = > It ' s so true about the case . It ' s a mission to get off and will break ur nails in the process . Also , you ' ll damage the case each time u try . For some reason the phone started giving me problems once I did succeed in opening it . = = = > Buttons could be a bit bigger . Vibration could be stronger . Good : = = = > Reception is not too shabby . I was using it in the elevator which is a remarkable feat considering my old phone would lose service by simply putting it in my pocket . = = = > Compared to my old Samsung , this phone works quite well . The ring tones are loud enough to hear and the phone actually charges quickly and has great battery life . It doesn ' t heat up like a potatoe in the oven either during long phone convos . = = = > Nice bright , large screen . = = = > Cute ways to customize it . Scroll bar can be set to purple , pink , aqua , orange , etc . Overall : Okay phone . It serves its purpose but definitely pales in comparison to these new phones coming out from Sprint . Why get so so when you can get great ?",
